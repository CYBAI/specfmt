<!-- This comment is similar to some in the HTML Standard, which contain the text of an opening block that is "exempt" from formatting. The rewrapper can't tell we're in a comment, so it treats, e.g., <style> as if it were a true opening style tag, and refuses to format anything else beneath it -->

                <li><p>This line obviously needs formatting, yet because of the HTML comment above, this line is mistakenly exempt from formatting.</p></li>
